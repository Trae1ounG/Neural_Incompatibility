The function `is_prime(n)` checks if a number `n` is prime. It returns True if `n` is prime and False otherwise. It starts by checking some base cases (n <= 1, n == 2, n % 2 == 0). Then, it iterates from 3 to the square root of `n`, checking if `n` is divisible by any odd number. If it is, then `n` is not prime. Otherwise, it is prime.\n\n2. The function `nth_prime(n)` finds the nth prime number. It starts with count = 0 and number = 2. It iterates through numbers starting from 2 and checks if each number is prime using the `is_prime()` function. If it is, it increments the count. When the count reaches n, it returns the current number as the nth prime number.\n\n3. The main code asks the user to enter the value of n and calls the `nth_prime()` function. If the returned result is not -1, it prints the nth prime number. Otherwise, it prints an error message.\n\nNote: Although this code uses only O(1) space, it has a time complexity of O(n * sqrt(n))."}]}
