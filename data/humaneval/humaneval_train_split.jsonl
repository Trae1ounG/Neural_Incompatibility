Next, we calculate the quotient by performing integer division (`//`) of `num1` by `num2`. The quotient represents how many times `num2` can be evenly divided into `num1`.\n\n3. We then calculate the product of the quotient and `num2`. If `num1` is evenly divisible by `num2`, the product should be equal to `num1`. This is because dividing `num1` by `num2` and multiplying the result by `num2` should give us back `num1` without any remainder.\n\n4.

Define a function `reverseString` that takes the input string as a parameter.\n2. Inside the function, check if the string is empty or has only one character. If so, return the string as it is.\n3. If the string has more than one character, split the string into two parts - the first character and the rest of the string.\n4. Call the `reverseString` function recursively on the rest of the string.\n5. Concatenate the reversed rest of the string with the first character and return the result.\n\nHere is the implementation in Python:\n\n```python\ndef reverseString(s):\n    if len(s) <= 1:\n        return s\n    else:\n        return reverseString(s[1:]) + s[0]\n\n# Example usage:\ninput_string = \"Hello, World!\"\nreversed_string = reverseString(input_string)\nprint(reversed_string)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n!dlroW ,olleH\n```\n\nIn this solution, we are using recursion with the implicit loop to reverse the string. Each recursive call processes a smaller part of the string until we reach the base case of an empty or single-character string. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string."}]}

On the other hand, a global variable is defined outside of any function or block, and its scope extends throughout the entire program.\n\nA local variable is typically used when you only need to access the variable within a specific function or block. It helps keep the code organized by isolating variables that are only relevant to a particular portion of the code. Here's an example:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_area(radius):\n    pi = 3.1415\n    area = pi * radius ** 2\n    return area\n\nradius = 5\nresult = calculate_area(radius)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `radius` variable is a global variable as it is defined outside any function. On the other hand, the `pi` and `area` variables are local variables since they are defined within the `calculate_area` function. They are only accessible within that function and not visible or usable outside it.\n\nA global variable, as the name suggests, is accessible from any part of the code. It can be useful when you need to share a value between multiple functions or blocks of code. However, overuse of global variables can make the code more difficult to understand and maintain. Here's an example:\n\n```python\ntax_rate = 0.2\n\ndef calculate_tax(income):\n    tax = income * tax_rate\n    return tax\n\ndef calculate_net_income(income):\n    tax = calculate_tax(income)\n    net_income = income - tax\n    return net_income\n\nincome = 5000\nresult = calculate_net_income(income)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `tax_rate` variable is a global variable as it is defined outside any function.

The `name` column is defined as `VARCHAR(100)` which can store strings up to 100 characters in length. The `NOT NULL` constraint ensures that every record must have a name value.\n3. The `CHECK` constraint on the `name` column uses a regular expression `'^[A-Za-z0-9]{5,}$'` to ensure that the name contains only letters (both uppercase and lowercase) and numbers and is at least 5 characters long. This disallows any special characters.\n4. The `salary` column is defined as `INTEGER` to store the employee's salary. The `DEFAULT 0` clause sets the default value of the salary column to 0 if not explicitly provided.\n5.

They define the methods, data formats, and rules for the interaction between applications. APIs act as intermediaries, enabling developers to access certain functionalities and resources of an application or service without having to understand the underlying code.\n\nIn a programming context, APIs are commonly used to access and use the features of external services, libraries, or frameworks. For example, social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter provide APIs that allow developers to integrate their applications with these platforms. Through these APIs, developers can retrieve user information, post updates, fetch feeds, and perform various operations on behalf of users.\n\nTo illustrate, consider a scenario where a developer is building a mobile app that requires users to sign in with their Facebook account. Instead of implementing the entire authentication system from scratch, the developer can use the Facebook API. This API provides methods for the app to authenticate users, request permission to access their profile information, and retrieve user details. By integrating the Facebook API, the developer can leverage the existing infrastructure and functionality of Facebook, saving time and effort in building the authentication process.\n\nIn summary, APIs simplify the integration of different software components, services, or platforms, enabling developers to leverage existing functionalities and resources without the need to understand the internal workings. They play a crucial role in connecting and expanding the capabilities of applications in the modern programming landscape."}]}

It checks whether the absolute value of each number is prime using the `is_prime` function, and if it is, it appends the number to the `primes` list.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `primes` list containing only the prime numbers from the input list of numbers.\n\nNote: The function `filter_primes` will only work correctly with integers.

It multiplies each value of `n` with the result of the recursive call.\n\nNow, let's consider a piece of erroneous code that attempts to use recursion but contains a logical error:\n\n```python\ndef countdown(n):\n    print(n)\n    countdown(n - 1)\n\ncountdown(5)\n```\n\nIn this code, the `countdown()` function attempts to print a countdown from a given number `n` to 1. However, the logical error occurs because there is no base case defined to stop the recursion. As a result, the function will keep calling itself indefinitely, leading to a \"RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded\" error.\n\nTo correct this code, a base case needs to be added to stop the recursion. The modified code could look like this:\n\n```python\ndef countdown(n):\n    if n <= 0:\n        return\n    print(n)\n    countdown(n - 1)\n\ncountdown(5)\n```\n\nIn the corrected code, the base case `n <= 0` is added to stop the recursion when the countdown reaches or goes below zero."}]}
